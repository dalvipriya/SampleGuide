# ABC Overview
Working on a new theme for WordPress? Need to create an example site for a client? Whatever the reason, using dummy content can help display what a site might actually look like once it goes live. Instead of creating your own posts and pages, itâ€™s easier to simply use some form of **WordPress** dummy content generator.
# Key Features
This product has following features.
## Feature 1: Reduces human efforts
Save time in **Word** with new buttons that show up where you need them. To change the way a picture fits in your document, click it and a button for layout options appears next to it. When you work on a table, click where you want to add a row or a column, and then click the plus sign.
Reading is easier, too, in the new Reading view. 
## Feature 2: Improves productivity
You can collapse parts of the document and focus on the text you want. If you need to stop reading before you reach the end, Word remembers where you left off - even on another device.
## Feature 3: Easy to use
To make your document look professionally produced, Word provides header, footer, cover page, and text box designs that complement each other. For example, you can add a matching cover page, header, and sidebar. Click **Insert** and then choose the elements you want from the different galleries.
